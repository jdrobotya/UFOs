# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this challenge is to provide in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results:
The existing html code was updated  for users to be able to filter for the date, city, state, country and shape. 
The user is able to filter table by one or multiple criterias.

## Summary:
I think this web site will be a great tool for all users who are seeking info on UFO sightings. Since more filters were added, it's much easier to look for the specific information based on city, country, shape and date. 

I'd suggest adding a "Search" button, since it's a little bit confusing what must happen next after you enter desired info into the filter fields. 

I'd also like the data set to be bigger. If we could scrape data from multiple web sites and store it in one data set that users can filter from, that would be great.
